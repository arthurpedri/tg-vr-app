## Paper
[Pedestrian Street Crossing Simulator in VR](<./A PEDESTRIAN STREET CROSSING VIRTUAL REALITY SIMULATOR FOR MOBILE DEVICES DEVELOPED IN UNITY.pdf>)

## Demo

## Requirements
We are using a deprecated library for Unity called `Google VR SDK for Unity` which is no longer supported on newer versions of Unity.

Thus we use Unity's long term support version `2019.4` to build this project.

This project also uses `Git Large File Storage` to store larger files more efficiently.
